 Test class files - Test class for each test scenario - can also run independently • Each file includes detailed documentation (by whom it was written / edited, when, what the function performs) • The code includes handling exception and reference to running in front of different environments and different data • Run log - to which the program will report any action • General results report - to which the plan will report the test results

Three tests with each test written in a separate test class that can run independently
a (Login with valid data)
b (Login attempt with a non-existent username and receiving a relevant error message)
c (Attempted login with incorrect password and receiving a relevant error message)
2. Each test will include writing a log and a final results report
3. At the end of each test, take a snapshot of the browser
